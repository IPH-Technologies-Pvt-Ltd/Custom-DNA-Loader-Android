## Description

The DNA Loader Animation in Kotlin is a lightweight and customizable loading animation for Android applications. It mimics the structure of a DNA double helix and provides an engaging visual element to keep users entertained while waiting for content to load.

## Features

- **Customizable Design**: You can easily customize the appearance of the DNA loader animation to match the style of your app. Adjust colors, sizes, and other visual properties to suit your project's design guidelines.

- **Easy Integration**: Integration into your Android project is straightforward. Simply copy the `DNAView` class and related code to your project, add the view to your XML layout, and start the animation with a single line of code.

- **Smooth Animation**: The animation is implemented using Android's animation framework, ensuring smooth and fluid motion that enhances the user experience.

- **Start and Stop Control**: You have full control over the animation lifecycle. Start the animation when you need to indicate loading, and stop it when your content is ready to be displayed.
